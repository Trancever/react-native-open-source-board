# react-native-open-source-board

[![Sponsored by Callstack][callstack-badge]][callstack]
[![tweet][tweet-badge]][tweet]

Open source board with "ready to pick up" issues from `react-native` and `react-native-community` repositories.

## Motivation

This repository aims to help developers interested in contributing to React Native open source repositories by providing them a list of triaged issues. It should decrease the entry level of writing RN OSS for beginners, but also allow more experienced contributors not to waste time scouring through the issues.

Every issue that lands on this list should be triaged and classified by the type of an issue and skillset required to pick it up.

This list is a living artifact, which means the state of the issue, might not always be up to date. It's an open source list, which means everyone can send a PR to remove or add issues.

I'll try to update this list as often as possible, if you want to stay up to date, click the button below.
